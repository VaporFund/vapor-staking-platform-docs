## Referral Rewards

### Reward Structure

| Tier | Referral Count | Commission Rate | Bonus |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Bronze** | 1-10 referrals | 5% | - |
| **Silver** | 11-50 referrals | 7% | +2% on all previous referrals |
| **Gold** | 51-100 referrals | 10% | +5% on all previous referrals |
| **Platinum** | 101+ referrals | 15% | +10% on all previous referrals |

### How Rewards Are Calculated

Referral rewards are calculated based on your referees' **staking rewards**:

```
Your Referral Reward = Referee's Staking Reward × Your Commission Rate
```

**Example:**

- Your referee stakes 1,000 USDC
- They earn 50 USDC in staking rewards (5% APY)
- Your commission rate is 10% (Gold Tier)
- **You earn: 50 × 10% = 5 USDC**

### Reward Distribution

- **Frequency**: Rewards distributed monthly
- **Payment Method**: Paid in the same token as the staking reward
- **Minimum Threshold**: 10 USD equivalent to claim rewards
- **Auto-Compound Option**: Automatically restake rewards to earn more

## FAQs

### General Questions

**Q: Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?**
A: No, you can refer unlimited users. The more you refer, the higher your tier and commission rate.

**Q: When do I receive my referral rewards?**
A: Rewards are distributed monthly. You can claim them once they reach the minimum threshold of 10 USD equivalent.

**Q: Can I refer myself using a different wallet?**
A: No, self-referrals are prohibited and will result in disqualification from the program.

**Q: What happens if my referee unstakes?**
A: You only earn rewards when your referees are actively earning staking rewards. If they unstake, you won't earn from that particular stake, but they remain your referral for future stakes.

### Tracking & Attribution

**Q: How long does the referral link tracking last?**
A: The referral cookie lasts 30 days. If someone clicks your link and stakes within 30 days, you get credit.

**Q: What if someone clicks multiple referral links?**
A: The first referral link clicked is credited (first-click attribution).

**Q: Can I see who I've referred?**
A: You can see anonymized wallet addresses and their staking activity, but not personal information (privacy-protected).

### Rewards & Payments

**Q: In what tokens do I receive referral rewards?**
A: You receive rewards in the same token that your referee earned staking rewards in (ETH, USDC, USDT, etc.).
